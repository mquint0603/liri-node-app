# LIRI Node App

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

## How to Use

LIRI allows you to look up song info on Spotify, movie info from OMBD, and can show you 20 recent tweets. The do-what-it-says command runs a default command (set in the random.txt file).

### Node commands

LIRI takes the following commands:
* spotify-this parameter
* movie-this  parameter
* my-tweets 
* do-what-it-says

If you don't provide a parameter you will be shown info for a default song or movie. 


Past searches can be found in the log.txt file.
